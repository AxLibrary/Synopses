\section*{The Testing Process}
\textbf{Testing} is a concurrent life cycle process of engineering, using, and maintaining testware in order to measure and improve the quality of the software being tested.
\\
\textbf{Black box testing} is a strategy in which testing is based solely on the requirements and specifications.
\\
\textbf{White box testing} is a strategy in which testing is based on the internal paths, structure, and implementations of the software under test.
\\
\textbf{Four testing levels}: Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance.
\section*{Black Box Testing Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
\item When using black box testing, the tester can never be sure of how much of the system under test has been tested.
\item Even though we can't test everything, formal black box testing directs the tester to choose subsets of tests that are both efficient and effective in finding defects.
\end{itemize}
